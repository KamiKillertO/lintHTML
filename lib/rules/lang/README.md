# lang

⚠ This rule does nothing. ⚠

The rule was not working properly and lack documentation so the rule has been "removed".
This rule has been inherited form HTMLLint but not removed to stay compatible (config).
The rule still exist to avoid reporting errors during config parsing but does nothing and return no errors.

Use [html-req-lang](../html-req-lang/README.md) and [lang-style](../lang-style/README.md) instead
